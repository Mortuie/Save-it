# Save It

Save It is a work-in-progress project for a simple budget management Android application.

We are university students who want a simple, easy-to-use, and intuitive budget manager on our smartphones.

### External libraries

We couldn't have made Save It look this good all by ourselves so we took a little help from some brilliant projects:

- [Caldroid](https://github.com/roomorama/Caldroid): a calendar display fragment
- [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/makovkastar/FloatingActionButton): a library to backport FloatingActionButton to older Android versions (>4)
